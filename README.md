My first readme
After spending time to play arround in the alx webterm command terminal doing different things like: creating and manipulating new directories, creating files, commits and pushing git commits, etc. I've now been granted permission to use GitHub.com GUI interface to edit this README.md, which is precisely the reason I'm doing this. I must confess, THIS IS SO MUSH FUN.
